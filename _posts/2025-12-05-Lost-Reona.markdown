# # Verse

# [F#9sus4]Cut my hair just because I thought that
# Maybe [DM13sus2]things would change
# [F#9sus4]Laughing at me and the things you see
# Tell me [DM13sus2]who's to blame?
# [F#9sus4]Falls to the ground, floating
# Just like gold dust it's [DM13sus2]sparkling
# [F#9sus4]Taking me back to the start, my spirits are [DM13sus2]darkening
# It [E6omit3]makes me feel so weak

# # Pre-Chorus

# [Bm7]Looking for [C#m7]a reason [D6sus2]why I [Esus4]can't compre[E]hend
# I [Bm7]feel the light[C#m7]ness in my [D6sus2]head
# Now my [G6]thoughts are clouded by [Esus4]strange things I [E]see

# # Chorus

# For every [F#9sus4]breath I take [DM13sus2]every day
# Every [E6omit3]drop of blood, [Aadd9]every stain [AM9/G#] 
# Like the [F#9sus4]moon, I will [DM13sus2]wax and wane

# Verse

Cut my hair just because I thought that
Maybe things would change
Laughing at me and the things you see
Tell me who's to blame?
Falls to the ground, floating
Just like gold dust it's sparkling
Taking me back to the start, my spirits are darkening
It makes me feel so weak

# Pre-Chorus

Looking for a reason why I can't comprehend
I feel the lightness in my head
Now my thoughts are clouded by strange things I see

# Chorus

For every breath I take every day
Every drop of blood, every stain
Like the moon, I will wax and wane
Circle's complete
For all thе promises that I keep
All the nights when I can't sleep
Evеry time that I held your hand
Iician far gesund gemynd
